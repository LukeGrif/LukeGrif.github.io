topic: OpenCV Underwater image mosaicing pipeline for ROV survey data
description: This repository contains Python code for stitching underwater images captured from a downward-facing ROV camera into a seamless seabed mosaic. The script uses SIFT-based feature matching, robust geometric transforms, and feathered blending to create high-quality mosaics from large image sets.
