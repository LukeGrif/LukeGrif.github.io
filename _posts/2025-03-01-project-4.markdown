description: Core machine vision techniques applied to real-world problems. I reconstructed images from sinograms using frequency-domain filtering, built a speed sign detector combining HSV color segmentation with 1-NN classification, and implemented Harris corner detection with RANSAC-based image stitching. Each project were designed, tested and implemented using Python.
